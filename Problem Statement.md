# Problem Statement for SmartDoc
## Title: Automated Document Classification and Storage System

### Background: 
In today's digital age, managing large volumes of documents can be a daunting task, especially when they are unstructured and scattered across different locations. Users often face difficulties in quickly locating and categorizing their documents, leading to inefficiencies and wasted time. Existing solutions may require manual sorting, which is time-consuming and prone to error.

### Objective: 
Develop a web application, SmartDoc, that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and automatically classify and store them into predefined categories using AI-driven text analysis.

### Key Features:

- Multi-file Upload: Allow users to upload multiple PDF files simultaneously via a user-friendly interface.<br>
- AI-based Classification: Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Google Generative AI) to analyze the content of the uploaded documents and classify them into categories such as resumes, contracts, newspapers, letters, emails, or forms.<br>
- Cloud Storage Integration: Store the classified documents in a cloud storage service (e.g., Google Cloud Storage) to ensure accessibility and reliability while eliminating the need for local storage management.<br>
- Downloadable Sorted Documents: Provide users with a downloadable zip file containing their categorized documents after processing, ensuring easy access to sorted files.

### Challenges:

- Implementing efficient and accurate text extraction from PDF documents.<br>
- Ensuring the reliability and scalability of the cloud storage solution.<br>
- Handling user uploads securely and efficiently.<br>
- Providing a smooth user experience with clear feedback during the upload and classification process.<br>
- Target Users: Individuals and organizations looking for an automated solution to manage and classify their documents efficiently.
